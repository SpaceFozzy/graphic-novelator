# Graphic Novelator

This project takes the text of a story and tries to use generative AI to build a graphic novel
experience of it.

Right now the plan is to:
1. âœ…Chunk the text
2. âœ…Iterate through the text and build a scene list with details
3. âœ…Generate images for those scenes
4. Serve the data and images as static assets from a web page

# Getting Started

1. `pip install langchain langchain-openai diffusers transformers`
2. Add your story as text.txt
3. `python3 start.py` will start generating scene descriptions and images for the whole story, with one image per 500 word chunk of text
4. `python3 start.py 17` will regenerate the scene description and image for the 17th chunk

# Examples (from Mary Shelly's Frankenstein)

## Scene Description
`A lone explorer stands at the edge of a frozen lake, the aurora borealis dancing across the dark sky behind him, as the icy landscape stretches out to the horizon, with the faint outline of a ship in the distance.`

## Image
Not sure why he's drifting on an iceberg but its a start ðŸ˜›
