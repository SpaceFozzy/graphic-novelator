## Graphic Novelator

This project takes the text of a story and tries to use generative AI to build a graphic novel
experience of it.

Next steps:
1. Add some styling to the pages
2. Allow generating a story in another location
3. Get dependencies under control (use a virtual environment or add containerization)
4. Clean up the code

## Creating Your Own Story

1. `pip install diffusers transformers`
2. Delete everything in `./example` and add your story as `example/text.txt`
3. `TITLE="Your Title" AUTHOR="Author" python3 start.py` will start generating scene descriptions, images, and html pages for the whole story, with one image per 500 word chunk of text
4. `TITLE="Your Title" AUTHOR="Author" python3 start.py 17` will regenerate the scene description and image for the 17th chunk
